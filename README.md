# RDAMP-Sales-Analysis
## About the Project
This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the RDAMP program. The project involves cleaning raw sales data using Python and performing business analysis with Power BI to uncover insights related to regional performance, discount strategies, and product-level profitability.

## Tools Used

Python (Pandas) - data cleaning and preparation
Power BI - creating interactive dashboards and visualizations
GitHub - version control, project submission and portfolio presentation

## My Approach

### Data Cleaning (Python):

Removed missing values and handled nulls
Exported the cleaned dataset for visualization in Power BI

### Visualization (Power BI):

Imported the cleaned dataset
Converted data types (e.g., Dates, Total sales, Cost Price, Profit)
Calculated Total Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, and Discount
Ensured consistency in column naming
Created visuals to show trends, segment-level analysis, and profit drivers
Applied filters, slicers, and calculated fields to drive insight

## Key Insights

1. Online vs In-Store Behavior
Online sales slightly outperformed in-store sales in both revenue and profit.

2. Regional Gaps
Wales and Yorkshire & the Humber show lower sales and profit compared to other regions.
Discount rates in those regions are high but not yielding profit.

3. Profitability by Category
Outdoor and Kitchen categories are the most profitable.
Some segments like Food show decent sales but low profit margin.

4. Segment-Level Discounts
Certain segments (e.g., Jams & Jellies) consistently offer high discounts, affecting profit.

5. Top & Bottom Performers
Electric Bikes are the best-selling product.
Packaged soups and canned foods show low profit despite sales.
